+THIS VERSION HAS BEEN SITTING ON MY DRIVE FOR MONTHS. THIS UPDATE WAS MADE AFTER 1.5.4 I DID NOT RELEASE IT DUE TO BUGS WITH THE NEW VERSION. 
I HAVE FIXED ALL THE ISSUES OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND IT IS NOW READY FOR PUBLIC USE.
THIS IS THE TRUE LAST UPDATE FOR THE MENU I HAVE OFFICALLY STOPPED WORKING ON IT.
A FULL MENU BASE HAS ALSO BEEN INCLUDED WITH THIS DOWNLOAD.
OPEN THE TEXT DOC AFTER DOWNLOAD TO GET THE MENU BASE DOWNLOAD VIA MEGA.
