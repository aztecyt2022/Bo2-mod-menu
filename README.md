changed the amount of time messages stays up on the screen for...time has been decreased(Less time on the screen.)

YES!
I have created a verification glitch again.
the system has to be in a certain order if not the menu cant tell where you are and may display the message saying you do not have permission even when you clearly do......
I can change it around until I find a order that works but as soon as I add a mod or add sub menus The issue will come back.....I have started to ignore this.
I will not let it spam the messages but I cannot stop them all.
