# Bo2-mod-menu!

Readme revision 7

Finally decided to change the compiled name to the proper name to load the menu via a gsc loader so you dont have to do it manually..


My loading issues where related to missing files in my bo2 directory.
when I added the new tesseract files and tu files to my bo2 I was able to load the menu!

I have made a few changes to the menu...
